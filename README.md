1. HiLiter_RSVHH.py generates plots of nucleotide changes in RSV genomes occuring across households. It takes as input a list of nucleotide alignments in fasta format and outputs a pdf of the figure (see Figure 2 in the manuscript or example commands and outputs in the alignment_lists_examples.zip directory). The set of 8 hoiusehold alignments is also provided (eight_RSV_HH_alignments.zip).

2. cartman_einfach.py is a simple nucleotide motif counting script using ack, a faster version of grep (http://beyondgrep.com/why-ack/). It takes as inputs a table of 21 nt motifs to count (usually with the variant nucleotide at nucleotide 11) and a list of paired fastq read files to examine. The paired reads are combined, and examined for motif content.Tthe umber of reads in the fastq file bearing the forward or reverse complement of the motif are reported in a csv table.
